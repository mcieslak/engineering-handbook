## BEM

The standard CSS methodology we use is [BEM](https://getbem.com/).

On 4th February 2021, frontend developers met to agree a CSS methodology for use in ETNA and a The National Archives toolkit.

Having considered a recommendation for utility CSS (as represented in Tailwind.css) and results of the most recent state of CSS survey, the team agreed that the BEM methodology would best reflect the needs of the team at this time.
