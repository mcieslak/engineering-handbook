# Our technology

## New applications

New National Archive applications should use the following approved languages and tools:

- [HTML](/developer-handbook/technology/html)
- [Python](/developer-handbook/technology/python)
- [JavaScript](/developer-handbook/technology/javascript) - for either [progressive enhancement](/developer-handbook/ways-of-working/service-standard/#progressive-enhancement) or for compiling web assets using tools like Webpack through NodeJS
- [CSS](/developer-handbook/technology/css)
- [Postgres](/developer-handbook/technology/postgres)
- [Docker](/developer-handbook/technology/containers) - to create deployable containers
- [Nginx](/developer-handbook/technology/nginx) - to provide a reverse proxy in front of Docker containers

In addition to this, developers are free to also use:

- [TypeScript](/developer-handbook/technology/typescript) - which must be compiled down to [JavaScript](/developer-handbook/technology/javascript)
- [SCSS](/developer-handbook/technology/css#scss) - allows us to more easily write CSS
