### React

React (along with other JavaScript libraries such as Vue and Angular) should not be used for any new National Archives applications.

As a JavaScript library, React on its own doesn't support our need for progressive enhancement. While it can be paired with frameworks like Next.js to provide SSR, many government departments have stopped using React and moved to more traditional technologies such as Python in order to provide better services.

GOV.UK stopped suggesting React and the repository that offered [GOV.UK React components](https://github.com/surevine/govuk-react-jsx) is no longer maintained.
