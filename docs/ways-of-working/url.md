# URLs

URLs and URIs in TNA services MUST:

- be clear, unambiguous, easy to read, easy to type and easy to share
- be in lower case
- align with the title of the page
- use words and should not contain acronyms, unless very well known or a department acronym (e.g. HMRC)
- separate words with dashes rather than underscores so they are easy to read
- not redirect a user to a non-government site
- use [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format if including a date

In addition, URLs and URIs in TNA services SHOULD:

- not use a, an, the and other superfluous words (e.g. `/press-room` rather than `/the-press-room`)
- use the verb stem where possible (e.g. `/find` rather than `/finding`)
- be based on user need rather than the name of a policy, scheme or service, which might change
- include the year when using a short URL for one-off promotion of an annual event such as `/events/summer-camp-2020`
- have no trailing slashes when sharing or printing URLs
