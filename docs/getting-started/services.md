Some teams with the organisation are using [Confluence](https://national-archives.atlassian.net/wiki/home) to document their ways of working, architectural decisions, and code. Where possible we try to document in the open as this enables reuse of our code but if an internal space is required, Confluence can be used. For more information on our documentation standards, see [Documentation](../ways-of-working/documentation.md).

## Docker

Many of our applications are built as containers using Docker. You will need to download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/) in order to build and run these containers.

Make sure that you download the correct version of Docker. If you have a newer Apple Mac then you may need the version of Docker that is specific to the Apple M-series chips.

Creating a [Docker account](https://hub.docker.com/signup) will give you a higher download limit. For anonymous users, the rate limit is set to 100 pulls per 6 hours per IP address but for authenticated users, it's 200 pulls per 6 hour period.

We have a set way of working and [standards for our containers](../../technology/containers/) to ensure security and consistency.

## GitHub

Our source code is stored on [GitHub](https://github.com/). You will need to [set up a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) in order to contribute to our projects.

Once you have an account, you need to be added to the [National Archives GitHub organisation](https://github.com/nationalarchives) as well as one of the [National Archives GitHub teams](https://github.com/orgs/nationalarchives/teams). Please ask your webmaster for access to this.

Read our [GitHub guidelines](../../third-party/github/) for a better idea of how we use GitHub as well as our our [version control standards](../../ways-of-working/version-control/).

## Jira

Many of our teams use [JIRA](https://national-archives.atlassian.net/jira) to manage projects and track changes. Each service has its own project in JIRA which is managed by the service team. JIRA can be very flexible, each team has designed their workflow to meet their needs.
