## GitHub

Our source code is stored on [GitHub](https://github.com/). You will need to [set up a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) in order to contribute to our projects.

Once you have an account, you need to be added to the [National Archives GitHub organisation](https://github.com/nationalarchives) as well as one of the [National Archives GitHub teams](https://github.com/orgs/nationalarchives/teams). Please ask your webmaster for access to this.

Read our [GitHub guidelines](../../third-party/github/) for a better idea of how we use GitHub as well as our our [version control standards](../../ways-of-working/version-control/).

## Docker

Most of our applications are built as containers using Docker. You will need to download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/) in order to build and run these containers.

Make sure that you download the correct version of Docker. If you have a newer Apple Mac then you may need the version of Docker that is specific to the Apple M-series chips.

Creating a [Docker account](https://hub.docker.com/signup) will give you a higher download limit. For anonymous users, the rate limit is set to 100 pulls per 6 hours per IP address but for authenticated users, it's 200 pulls per 6 hour period.

We have a set way of working and [standards for our containers](../../technology/containers/) to ensure security and consistency.
