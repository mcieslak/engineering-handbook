# Getting started

Welcome to The National Archives. This guide will hopefully help you, as a new engineer, get started.

## Laptop(s)

Depending on your role and team within the organisation you may have been given an "unmanaged" or "developer" laptop, this is likely in addition to your "corporate" laptop. It is your responsibility to manage this device, ensuring that the device remains remains secure at all times. Due to the varying technologies used across the organisation we do not specify an operating system, many of our developers use Mac or Ubuntu. Ask your team about what they'd recommend and their policy on how these devices MUST be configured; the following bullets are likely repeated in you team's policy.

- Record data MUST NOT be stored or access on an unmanaged device.
- All devices MUST have disk encryption enabled. E.g. BitLocker for Windows, FileVault for Mac, or LUKS for Linux.
- All devices MUST have antivirus software installed and configured to scan both periodically and on-demand.
- All devices MUST be kept up to date with security and other patches.
- All device passwords MUST be strong and meet the same requirements as our corporate IT systems. Passwords MUST NOT be re-used between devices.
