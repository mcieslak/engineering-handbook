# The Technical Architects Group

## What the TAG does

- Develop and maintain a Tech Welcome Pack
- Review and Ownership of shared threat handling and operational decision making authority across services
- Operational policy making decisions: e.g. use and scoping of AWS accounts, shared areas for teams to store documentation and components they have used, use of toolsets by service teams (keep an up-to-date lists of toolsets used by service teams with the expectation being that new teams should select from this tool-set and can only choose a new toolset with permission from TAG), amendments to firewall rule-sets that impact more than one service
- Work with service teams in Explore and Alpha phases (TAs to stay within their departmental boundaries for this work?) to provide a technical optionâ€™s appraisal, which can be reviewed and signed off by Tech Governance Board, and which will provide budget holders with assurance for spend approval
